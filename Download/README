This directory contains scripts for downloading, formatting, and
lightly cleaning, daily displacement time series for GPS stations in
the Pacific Northwest. Running "make_data.sh" will generate a PyGeoNS
data file named "data.h5" as well as a file "data.txt" which contains
a list of edits made to the dataset.
