This directory contains scripts for cleaning raw GPS displacement time
series. The data was broken up spatially into sections and then
temporally broken up by year. Each data subset was cleaned with
pygeons autoclean. The cleaned data subsets were merged together in
the file *data.clean.merged.h5*. Finally, the merged data was visually
inspected, manually edited, and saved in *data.final.h5*. Manual edits
are recorded in *data.final.txt*.
