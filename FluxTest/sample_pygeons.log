usage: pygeons SUBCOMMAND ...

PyGeoNS is a command-line application for analyzing GPS
displacement timeseries. PyGeoNS is primarily intended for computing
time-dependent strain rates, which illuminates any transient
deformation in the dataset. Strain rates are computed using Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR). PyGeoNS can produce more than just
strain-rates; it can use GPR to spatially/temporally smooth the GPS
data or compute its spatial/temporal derivatives. PyGeoNS also
provides subroutines for interactive viewing and cleaning.

positional arguments:
  SUBCOMMAND  PyGeoNS sub-command. This can be any of ['info', 'toh5',
              'totext', 'vector-view', 'strain-view', 'clean', 'crop',
              'strain', 'reml']. Call "pygeons" followed by the sub-command
              and '-h' to see more information.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
